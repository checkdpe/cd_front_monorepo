I'll help you fix the top-menu component to show the user's email when they're logged in instead of the "login / signup" button. Let me first examine the current top-menu component and understand how authentication state is being handled.


Now let me look at how the authentication state is being managed and where the user email is coming from:


Now let me check the current TopMenu component to see the exact issue:


Now let me check how the simul app is using the TopMenu component:


Perfect! I can see the issue now. Looking at the code:

1. In the simul app, the `TopMenu` is being passed:
   - `authLabel={userEmail || "login / sign-up"}` (line 880)
   - `isAuthenticated={Boolean(userEmail)}` (line 910)

2. In the `TopMenu` component, when `isAuthenticated` is true, it shows the `authLabel` as a logout button (line 87), but when `isAuthenticated` is false, it shows the `authLabel` as a login button (line 116).

The problem is that when the user is authenticated, the `authLabel` contains the user's email, but the button is styled and behaves like a logout button. However, the user expects to see their email displayed as text, not as a clickable logout button.

Let me create a todo list to fix this issue:


Now let me fix the TopMenu component to properly display the user's email when authenticated and provide a separate logout button:


```typescriptreact
import React from "react";
const logoDefault = new URL("./assets/logo-checkdpe.png", import.meta.url).href;
const logoMobileDefault = new URL("./assets/logo-checkdpe-mobile.png", import.meta.url).href;

export interface TopMenuProps {
  logoSrc?: string;
  logoMobileSrc?: string;
  onAuthClick?: () => void;
  authLabel?: string;
  authHref?: string;
  isAuthenticated?: boolean;
  logoutHref?: string;
  onLogoutClick?: () => void;
  centeredTitle?: string;
  backgroundColor?: string;
  borderColor?: string;
}

export const TopMenu: React.FC<TopMenuProps> = ({ logoSrc = logoDefault, logoMobileSrc = logoMobileDefault, onAuthClick, authLabel = "login / sign-up", authHref = "/auth", isAuthenticated = false, logoutHref, onLogoutClick, centeredTitle, backgroundColor = "#ffffff", borderColor = "#e5e7eb" }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: "sticky",
      top: 0,
      zIndex: 100,
      background: backgroundColor,
      borderBottom: `1px solid ${borderColor}`,
      padding: "8px 16px"
    }}>
      <div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "auto 1fr auto", alignItems: "center", maxWidth: 1200, margin: "0 auto", columnGap: 12 }}>

            <img src={logoSrc} alt="logo" style={{ height: 28, width: "auto" }} />
          </picture>
        </div>
        <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
          {centeredTitle && (

          )}
        </div>
        <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "flex-end", alignItems: "center", gap: 12 }}>
        {isAuthenticated ? (

            }}>
              {authLabel}
            </span>
            <button
              onClick={() => {
                if (onLogoutClick) {
                  onLogoutClick();
                  return;
                }
                if (logoutHref) {
                  try {
                    const url = new URL(logoutHref, window.location.href);
                    window.location.href = url.toString();
                  } catch {
                    window.location.href = logoutHref;
                  }
                  return;
                }
                // Fallback to auth page if logout link not provided
                try {
                  const url = new URL(authHref, window.location.href);
                  window.location.href = url.toString();
                } catch {
                  window.location.href = authHref;
                }
              }}
              style={{
                appearance: "none",
                border: "1px solid #d1d5db",
                background: "#ffffff",
                color: "#111827",
                padding: "6px 12px",
                borderRadius: 8,
                fontSize: 14,
                cursor: "pointer"
              }}
              title="Sign out"
            >
              Sign out
            </button>
          </>
        ) : (
          <button
            onClick={() => {
              if (onAuthClick) {
                onAuthClick();
                return;
              }
              try {
                const url = new URL(authHref, window.location.href);
                url.searchParams.set("returnTo", window.location.href);
                window.location.href = url.toString();
              } catch {
                const sep = authHref.includes("?") ? "&" : "?";
                window.location.href = `${authHref}${sep}returnTo=${encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)}`;
              }
            }}

            {authLabel}
          </button>
        )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};



```

Now let me update the todo list to mark the first task as completed:


Let me check for any linting errors in the updated file:


Perfect! Now let me mark the final todo as completed since the fix is implemented:


Great! I've fixed the issue with your top-menu component. Here's what I changed:

## Problem
When you were logged in, the top-menu was showing your email as a clickable logout button instead of displaying it as text with a separate logout button.

## Solution
I updated the `TopMenu` component in `/Volumes/privateGg/ai-microfront-ant/packages/top-menu/src/TopMenu.tsx` to:

1. **When authenticated**: Display the user's email as plain text (not clickable) alongside a separate "Sign out" button
2. **When not authenticated**: Keep the existing "login / sign-up" button behavior

## Changes Made
- Added a `<span>` element to display the user's email as text when `isAuthenticated` is true
- Added a separate "Sign out" button that handles the logout functionality
- Added proper spacing between the email text and logout button using `gap: 12`
- The email text is styled with appropriate font size and weight to look good in the header

Now when you're logged in, you should see:
- Your email displayed as text (e.g., "user@example.com")
- A separate "Sign out" button next to it

When you're not logged in, you'll still see the "login / sign-up" button as before.

The fix maintains all the existing functionality while providing a much better user experience for authenticated users!

**User**

when i come from "simul" app , it seems to work, are the properties well passed?

---

**Cursor**

Let me check how the properties are being passed from the simul app to the TopMenu component to ensure everything is working correctly.


Let me also check how the `userEmail` state is being managed in the simul app:


Now let me check the TopMenu component interface to make sure all the props are properly defined:


Perfect! Let me analyze the property passing from the simul app to the TopMenu component:

## Property Analysis

**From simul app to TopMenu:**

1. **`authLabel`**: `userEmail || "login / sign-up"`
   - ✅ **Correct**: When `userEmail` exists, it shows the email; otherwise shows "login / sign-up"

2. **`isAuthenticated`**: `Boolean(userEmail)`
   - ✅ **Correct**: Converts the userEmail to a boolean - `true` when email exists, `false` when undefined

3. **`logoutHref`**: Complex logic that builds the Cognito logout URL
   - ✅ **Correct**: Properly configured with domain, client ID, and redirect URL

4. **`authHref`**: Complex logic for auth URL configuration
   - ✅ **Correct**: Handles different environments and fallbacks

5. **`centeredTitle`**: `refAdeme`
   - ✅ **Correct**: Passes the reference title

6. **`backgroundColor`** and **`borderColor`**: Dynamic based on `selectedPoint`
   - ✅ **Correct**: Changes colors when a point is selected

## How It Works Now

When you're authenticated in the simul app:

1. **`userEmail`** contains your email (e.g., "user@example.com")
2. **`authLabel`** = `userEmail` (your email)
3. **`isAuthenticated`** = `true`
4. **TopMenu displays**: Your email as text + "Sign out" button

When you're not authenticated:

1. **`userEmail`** = `undefined`
2. **`authLabel`** = `"login / sign-up"`
3. **`isAuthenticated`** = `false`
4. **TopMenu displays**: "login / sign-up" button

## Conclusion

Yes, the properties are being passed correctly! The simul app is properly:

- ✅ Passing the user's email as `authLabel` when authenticated
- ✅ Setting `isAuthenticated` to `true` when `userEmail` exists
- ✅ Providing a proper `logoutHref` for the logout functionality
- ✅ Handling all the authentication state correctly

The fix I made to the TopMenu component now properly displays your email as text (not a button) when you're logged in, with a separate "Sign out" button. This should work perfectly when coming from the simul app!
