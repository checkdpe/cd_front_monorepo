check test

**Cursor**

I'll scan the repo's configs and the button test to see why Vitest can't resolve `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, then propose a fix.

I'll open `startup.sh` and the test/package configs in parallel to confirm the tooling setup and the test file contents, then adjust config if needed.

I'll quickly inspect `apps/landing/package.json` to confirm React is installed and version, and also check `packages/button/src/Button.tsx` for JSX config alignment.

I inspected the configs and confirmed Vitest fails because React isn't available at the root for the JSX dev runtime. I'll add `react` and `react-dom` at the root, install, and re-run tests.

- I added `react` and `react-dom` as dev deps at the workspace root so Vitest can resolve `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, then re-ran tests.

- All tests now pass:
```text
✓ packages/button/Button.test.tsx (3 tests)
```

- You can run: `pnpm test` to verify locally.

add antd library

**Cursor**

I'll check the landing app's entry files to know where to wire Ant Design, then install `antd` for the landing app and import its reset CSS.

I'll install Ant Design into the landing app, then wire its reset CSS import, and finally build the app to verify.

```typescriptreact
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "antd/dist/reset.css";
import { App } from "./App";
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(<App />);

```

- Installed `antd` and `@ant-design/icons` for `@acme/landing`.
- Wired Ant Design reset CSS by importing `antd/dist/reset.css` in `apps/landing/src/main.tsx`.
- Verified the landing app builds successfully.

You can start the app and try Ant Design components:
- Dev server: `pnpm --filter @acme/landing dev`
- Example usage in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
import { Button as AntButton } from "antd";
// ...
<AntButton type="primary">AntD</AntButton>
```

```typescriptreact
import { Button as AntButton } from "antd";
// ...
<AntButton type="primary">AntD</AntButton>
```

would you update "Button" package to rely on antd?

I'll scan the button package files to understand its current API and adjust it to wrap Ant Design's Button while keeping tests passing.

I'll refactor the `@acme/button` component to wrap Ant Design's `Button`, add `antd` as a peer/dev dependency in the package, and then run tests to ensure everything passes.

I'll add Ant Design as a peer/dev dependency for `@acme/button`, refactor `src/Button.tsx` to wrap AntD's `Button`, then run tests.

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/button",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": false,
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts"
  },
  "files": [
    "src",
    "README.md"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json",
    "check": "tsc -b && eslint . && vitest run",
    "test": "vitest",

  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "antd": "^5.0.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "antd": "^5.27.4",
    "@acme/theme-tokens": "workspace:*",
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.3.1",
    "typescript": "^5.5.4",
    "vitest": "^1.6.0"
  }
}
```

```javascript
const mapProps = ({label, variant, disabled, onClick}: ButtonProps) => (
  <AntButton type="primary" ghost={variant === 'ghost'} disabled={disabled} onClick={() => { if (!disabled && onClick) onClick(); }}>
    {label}
  </AntButton>
);
```

I'll refactor `packages/button/src/Button.tsx` to wrap Ant Design's Button and map our `variant` to AntD props, then install dependencies and run tests.

```typescriptreact
import React from "react";
import { Button as AntButton } from "antd";
import "@acme/theme-tokens/css";
import type { ButtonProps } from "../schema";

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, variant = "primary", disabled, onClick }) => {
  const isGhost = variant === "ghost";
  return (
    <AntButton
      type="primary"
      ghost={isGhost}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={() => { if (!disabled && onClick) onClick(); }}
    >
      {label}
    </AntButton>
  );
};

```

I’m going to fix the TypeScript config error by correcting the base config types entry, then rebuild the button package and run tests.

```jsonc

  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": [

# @acme/button
Minimal button built on Ant Design.

## API
```ts
type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'ghost';
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
};
```

Notes
- Internally uses `antd`'s `Button` with `type="primary"` and `ghost` mapped from `variant`.
- Requires peer deps: `react`, `react-dom`, and `antd`.

```

- Updated `@acme/button` to wrap Ant Design’s `Button`, mapping our `variant` to AntD’s `ghost` prop and using `type="primary"`.
- Added `antd` as a peer dependency (and dev dep for local build) in `packages/button/package.json`.
- Fixed TS base config types to `@testing-library/jest-dom`. Rebuilt and all tests pass.

Usage remains the same:
```tsx
import { Button } from "@acme/button";

<Button label="Primary" />
<Button label="Ghost" variant="ghost" />
```

If you want to expose more AntD features (size, loading, danger), I can extend our props and pass them through.

```typescriptreact
import { Button } from "@acme/button";

<Button label="Primary" />
<Button label="Ghost" variant="ghost" />
```
